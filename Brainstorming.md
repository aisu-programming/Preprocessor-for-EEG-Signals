   - Goal
     Propose a GAN-style model to either clean (denoise), augment, or super-resolution the data.
     Super-resolution can channel-wise or timestep-wise.

1. (Unclear) Data Augmentation
   - Goal
     Propose a (novel) method/pipeline to improve the ability of the model for eliminating unrelated signals.
     - Mixup all datasets with different subjects and tasks
     - Do Noise Injection / Jittering on the data
